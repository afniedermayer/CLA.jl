This repository contains a reference implementation of the Critical Line Algorithm as described in [Niedermayer and Niedermayer (Applying Markowitz's Critical Line Algorithm)](http://www.springer.com/business+%26+management/finance/book/978-0-387-77438-1), 2010
Handbook of Portfolio Construction: Contemporary Applications of
Markowitz Techniques", edited by John Guerard, London: Springer, 2010, see also [the working paper version](http://www.vwl.unibe.ch/papers/dp/dp0701.pdf).

The reference implementation is intended to be as close as possible to the pseudo-code in the paper, even if this comes at the cost of performance.
For a fast implementation, see the [repository with the Fortran version](https://bitbucket.org/afniedermayer/fast_critical_line_algorithm) (which also
contains Python bindings for the Fortran code).
